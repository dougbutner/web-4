# Web 4.0 - The Democratic Web

## About This Repo 

This repo features a description of the next evolution of the web, web 4.0. As the technologies emerge, this repo will also feature links to the  associated technologies.

## What is Web 4.0?

Before we define web 4.0, we must look briefly at the concepts of web 1.0, web 2.0, and web 3.0. We will remove the ".0" for the rest of this document.

 - **Web 1**
Static files being served from a server to a user's browser.
 - **Web 2**
Dynamic pages that took user's information and desires into account. Asynchronous requests allow single page applications to thrive. Applications are still served from a central (federated) server.
 - **Web 3**
Decentralized web. Applications exist in distributed networks instead of a central server. This unfederated model trades control and censorship ability for freedom and lack of opinion.

As more and more individuals and societies are reconsidering the place of government, censorship, and capitalism,  web 3 a

A growing portion of websites and applications today have elements of web 3 

## Defining Web 4

There are 3 foundational underpinnings of web 4

 1. Time-issued cryptocurrency 
 2. Biocryptographic signatures
 3. Socioeconomic applications

We will discuss these foundations one at a time

# Time-issued cryptocurrency (Time Tokens) 

Time tokens are distributed to users based on the amount of time passes. This can be an active faucet, requiring some action by the recipient, or a passive faucet, automatically sending the cryptocurrency to the user. 

Time tokens allow web 2 and web 3 applications to offer a provably democratic model to their users. 


Provable democracy cannot be fully achieved in web 3.0, because there is no control over how many accounts a user may control. Instead, many different models have been developed to deal with this issue, most notably, proof of work, proof of stake, and delegated proof of stake. 

These paradigms of democracy are used primarily to determine which chain of transaction blocks is considered valid, securing a blockchain. POS and DOPS are also used to in applications like Hive to allow users to declare
