[![Mentioned in Awesome Web 4](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/dougbutner/awesome-web4)

## About This Repo 

This README features a description of the next evolution of the web, **web 4**. As the technologies emerge, this repo will also feature code and links to the associated technologies. For more cool Web 4 stuff, visit the [**Awesome Web 4**](https://github.com/dougbutner/awesome-web4) **repo**.

## What is Web 4?



Web 4 is a set of **modular paradigms** and practices that allow integration of **provable democracy in any social system** that seeks to be more collaborative (organization, government, community, etc.). Modularity allows any project to adopt one or more of these principles to **increase the accuracy, fairness, and transparency** of each individual's role in **collaboration**. 

Web 4 is **built on top of web 3** (it's blockchain-based) while being **fundamentally different** and providing enough **benefit to society** warrant the new title of web 4. 

In essence, web 4 is **positive attention catalyzer**, built on providing power to every that only gains meaning when they give it freely to another. This power is also freely given, and limited by time. 

> Web 4 is not a single JS or other library, It's a philosophy enacted on top of a web 3 environment. 

In this manifesto, I will define each of the components of web 4, provide basic psudeocode  

# Background

Before we define web 4 fully, we must look briefly at the concepts of web 1, web 2, and web 3. 

 - **Web 1**
**Static web**. Files are served from a remote server to a user's browser.

 - **Web 2**
**Dynamic web**. Web pages that take user's information and desires into account. Asynchronous requests allow single page applications to thrive. Applications are still served from a central server.

 - **Web 3**
**Decentralized web**. Open-source applications exist in distributed networks instead of a central server. This unfederated model trades control and censorship ability for freedom and lack of opinion. 

 - **Web 4**
**Democratic web**. Enabling meaningful layers on top of current socioeconomic systems built on time-minted crypto versatile which gains utility in how it is spent. Open source, unfederated biocryptography allows democratic systems to flourish, and takes government identification and corporate oversight out of the picture. Intentional degradation of information changes blockchain paradigms and brings meaning to time-based information models. 

Today, the top 100 websites by traffic are [all](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) web 2 websites. The web 2 paradigm fits closely with the wider environment of **corporate-owned information.** 

As more and more individuals and societies are reconsidering the place of **government, censorship, centralization and federated power**, web 3 has emerged as a powerful, provable option to **shape the evolution of society** on planet Earth. 

A growing portion of web 2 websites and applications today have elements of web 3, like [cryptoblogs](https://peakd.com) and [games](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings/category/games). While web 2 and web 3 can operate independently, web 3 enhances the abilities of web 2. 

As web 3 matures, we start to open a **pandoras box of practical applications**. With transaction fees near non-existent on second layers, we can re-imagine what is possible. 

Web 4 dreams up **proof of individuality** through encrypted biodata that kickstarts a collaborative society, one driven by enabling each individual with **free daily tokens** that can be burnt to complete an action, e.g. voting on a community proposal. 


Web 4 lays the foundation for this to be built. But, like any democratic system. **We need your help.** Please read this paper, and consider these ideas. If you believe you can make them better, please **submit a pull request** with your ideas. If you are a developer, I want to remind you of the license of this repo, and **invite you to forge any of these ideas into hot-pressed applications**. 

## Guiding Philosophy
Web 4 seeks to implement systems in **harmony with the universe itself** by replicating nature: the **abundance** of the Sun, rising **entropy**, and the **equality** of each conscious being. 

When we create information systems in **harmonic resonance** with natural systems, our society will be able to advance more rapidly than ever before, as we will be able to **"fit in" with the larger systems of information processing** around us (the Earth, Sun, and Galactic core). 

By matching the wavelength of the galaxy, universe, and our own, we share more actively and intentionally, collectively, all around the world, working with the energy of the Earth, utilizing the Sun, and synchronizing with the moon

## Defining Web 4
Web 4 introduces **four modular components** for **provably democratic systems** built on top of web 3's open-source decentralized networks. 

There are 4 conceptual underpinnings (modules) of web 4

 1. **Time-issued cryptocurrency** 
	 Individuals may receive "Time Tokens" at given intervals
 2. **Proof of Individuality**
	 Biometric Secrets, Social Verification, more
 3. **Pseudonymity and Information Entropy**
	 Information degradation over time, pseudo accounts in sensitive systems
 4. **Harmonic GeoSocial Systems**
	 Reflecting lessons in nature into our systems to evolve socioeconomics,

Each idea can be used separately or in tandem. This paper invites you to involve any of these ideas into your current and future projects. 

In the following sections, we will discuss solutions to these concepts one at a time, then look at possible applications of these web 4 concepts, and a **roadmap to reality**.


# Why we can't have Provable democracy with web 3
> Provable democracy cannot be fully achieved in web 3 itself because there is no control over how many accounts a user may own.

Democracy is essentially reaching a consensus with the idea that **each person is equal** in their influence on that consensus within defined bounds.

Many different consensus models have been developed, most notably, [proof of work](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work) (**POW**), [proof of stake](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake) (**POS**), and [delegated proof of stake ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/delegated-proof-of-stake-explained)(**DPOS**). These paradigms of consensus are used primarily to determine which chain of transaction records (blocks) is considered valid, securing a blockchain. 

POS and DPOS is additionally used to in projects like [**Hive**](https://peakd.com) to allow users to "vote" on valuable content, an early example of the democratic web. DPOS is also used for networks to determine who can access network resources.

However, both of these POS/DPOS use cases (curation and resource allocation) are not democratic in the sense that **each account is not equal**. In both cases, the root of democracy is in the token, not the individual, and the ownership of tokens determines the voting power or processing power held by an individual. 

In the end, the only way to implement true democracy in any system is through giving **each individual equal power**. The only way to do this while keeping web3's decentralized nature is to implement the technological (biosecrets) and idealogical (time tokens, information entropy) advancements needed to be sure an account is owned by **one individual**, and that individual has **only one account**. These advancements are, for simplicity and communication, called web 4.

# Time-issued cryptocurrency (Time Tokens) 

Time tokens are distributed to users' wallets periodically as time passes. They work by hashing a unique personal identifier (address) with a time identifier, linking each token to a person during a span of time.

These tokens provide the user with an action. The action burns the token, which may cause some change in the state of a system, or minting of another token, or any other action. 

## The Gears of Time Tokens

Time tokens rely on the following concepts:

 1. **Time Unit**
A time unit MUST be a superset of a timestamp. This means that a time unit is some amount (or fraction) of seconds. Each time token MUST be the only one in existence stamped with a particular time unit for each user (wallet). 
 2. **Time Token Faucet**
A time faucet offers any verified user EXACTLY one time token per unit of time passed since their last faucet. This can be an active faucet; requiring some action by the recipient, or a passive faucet; automatically sending the cryptocurrency to the user.
 3. **Verified Recipients**
Recipients of the system MUST be verified to be an actual human in order to receive time tokens. Biocryptographic secrets are suggested as the solution to this problem, and examined further down.  


For a full description of Time Tokens, visit the  [Time Token repository](https://github.com/dougbutner/time-token). 


## How do Time Tokens work?
Time tokens store a time unit (integer) with a unique user identifier (string) in a hash signed by the user's biocryptographic signature.

Time tokens are platform independent, and need only store simple data involving time unit and an account identifier at the most bare level.

Here is the minimum information stored in a time token, using [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/) as an example
```
{
  "header": {
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "HS256"
  },
  "payoadData": {
    "time-unit": 294957,
    "userid": "7f3e873a2c3d"
  }
}
```
For the time token to be spendable, a signed JWT Time Token (Mechanics example)

See Appendix A for the pseudocode of a time token. 
```
const passedBioData = {..} // biodata from user

const header = {
        "typ": "JWT",
        "alg": "HS256"
      }

const payloadData = {
	"time-unit": "294957", 
	"userid": "7f3e873a2c3d", 
	"appData": {
		"gold": 479,
		"honey": 23,
		"axe": 0 
	}
}

const bioSecret = bioKeyGenerator(passedBioData); // Biometric provider's key or one generated direcly by user

signature = HMACSHA256(
	base64UrlEncode(header) + "."+
	base64UrlEncode(payloadData), 
	bioSecret
)


function bioKeyGenerator(bioData){
	// Function takes data in the form of user input into their browser or smartphone.
	// With data, quantifyable points are taken algorithmically	
	// These points expanded to a pre-defined margin of error geometrically for each input type
	// A matrix-like object containing every single possible hashed value for every point of data 
	// ..must be stored on an authentication server for each data input. 
	// Data must  exhibit granularity (snap to an integer path)
	// This matrix of values is used to compare the biosecret with in the future
	// This must be made more efficient to use with today's computers
	// There is a example of this in Appendix A
}

function sendToAuthServer(){
	// Send data to registered auth server
}


```
The notable parts here are the `time-unit` and `userid` in the payload, and the `signingSecret` which is generated by a user's biometric data.

We have said we web 4 is based on web 3 (blockchain), but this example used only **web 2 technology**, so the ability to do it is at all begs the question:


## Why can't web 2 or 3 be used for Time Tokens?

Of course they can! It's just not viable to fulfill all principles of web 4 , but can be done to an extent. 

Web 2 is not a viable candidate for **provable democracy** because the federated nature means that your biometric data **must be trusted** to a third party, possibly a large corporation or malicious actor.

## **Proof of Individuality - Biometric Secrets + Protecting Identity**
> **Please Note:** There are solutions available today (like [FaceTec](https://www.facetec.com/)) that solve the same issues presented here. This paper seeks to outline a "better" system that can be ran without a centralized actor. 

**Biometric secrets** are akin to any cryptographic secret key, they are a hash of information. The information hashed in a biometric secret comes from a person's biometric expression. In today's biometric space,  static images are most commonly used for things like fingerprint and facial recognition, and geometry is the means to compare this data. 

Biometric secrets generated from static images are not secure, as static images can be faked. [2] Video offers a better solution to this problem, as it is harder to fake, can include audio, and lets developers create a whole new set of algorithms based on a changing stream of data. 

### What is used to generate a biosecret?
This stream of data (video + audio biometric expression) could be a user doing a series of hand gestures, singing a part of a song, speaking a phrase, speaking a phrase in different voices, clapping, making a series of facial expressions, or anything else one can imagine.

For security, biometric expressions must be unique (for example, which combination of words to speak) and many types (gesture, singing, clapping) must be available and used in combination. If each person's biometric secret was generated from the same single biometric expression, it would be a matter of time before specific AI could be developed to deepfake it for anyone. If the user is the only one that knows their biometric expressions it becomes nearly impossible to guess the type and nature of the expression, and even if that is known, impossible to use the same technique on more than one account. The nature of the uniqueness could be chosen by the user, or generated at random from the biosecret software which would prompt the user to complete an action in a specific way. 

## Why do we need this, again?
Democratic systems certainly **are being built** without biometric verification, and **must be**  until suitable biometric technology develops along the open source, client-side requirements. For now, **decentralized solutions** like [Civic](https://www.civic.com/), and centralized tech like [Facetec](https://www.facetec.com/FaceTec_3D_Face_Matching_Whitepaper.pdf) provide the necessary individuality at the cost of some trust and requirement of citizenship. As different projects implement web 4 in their own ways, the ideas presented thus far will develop, as flaws are found. 

We will present the ideas that are crucial for this system to be different, and represent true growth into web 4.


**Key Aspects** 
1. **Biometric Expression**: A user is presented with a choice of different biometric options used to generate a hash that can only belong to this person. 
User can choose to either perform a chosen biometric task to receive their hashed biosecret (trustless) or generate it at any time from a third party provide (trust). Any third party provider will generate the same hash by a set or open-source algorithms. 

2. **Biosecret Generation**: User's sensitive biological information and generated algorithmic results are destroyed (made impossible to reconstruct) at the layer of hashing, and data not stored in any way, public or private, as the user runs the software on their local machine (assuming they choose the open-source software, not a third party).

The biggest issue with biometrics is the lack of trust, mostly due to the growing number of facial recognition softwares and databases. The lack of trust is almost always associated with an individual's lack of consent, not the technology itself. 

### To alleviate the trust issue, solutions must be: 
1) open-source
2) run entirely on the individual's hardware (client-side), and 
3) not expose any biometric data to any other users or the system itself. 

There will always be **security concerns** with biometrics. For example, if a user uses their biometric secret to unlock their mobile device, another app could be secretly recording the camera in the background. A person could record them doing their secret, and try to play that video back to the camera to gain access. Also, *[deepfakes.](https://github.com/aerophile/awesome-deepfakes)* These concerns must be addressed before this web 4 reaches mass adoption. 

The upside of biometric secrets is they **cannot be lost**, and the account will always be recoverable by the individual. In a web 4 ecosystem, where the tokens are distributed daily and often spent daily, a hack would be much less catastrophic. The attacker will be able to access the user's balance, but not alter the past transactions, nor continue to collect the future deposits, because the real user will (in theory) quickly recover the account and change the biometric secret generation means so that the hacker's biofake is no longer working.

## Degradation of Information
Web 3 focuses on storing information forever in a provable way. Web 4 introduces a **counter-model** which may be **optionally** adopted by any time-token-based system. In this model, who did what becomes **harder and harder to know** the more time that passes. 

This idea hinges upon incremental time units, the number of which is used to decide how difficult information about a particular individual is to access. 

With **pseudonymity**, it is difficult, but not impossible, to piece together a story about an individual user by knowing they are responsible for a set of transactions over time. The further back in time a transaction is, the **harder** it is to link it to another transaction with any **certainty**. 

## **Degradation of Information Fidelity**
Information fidelity requirements can also be degraded over time. For example, when generating a users **biosecret**, it can be assumed that the more time that passes, the more the **bioinformation** of the individual will **change**. 

**Biosecrets** are generated from a **range of biometric values**. This range of values can be expanded over time. The effect is, instead of having one hashed biosecret for eternity, the generation process will create a set of biosecrets from an increasingly **wide range of data**. This concept may be needed to keep people in control of their accounts as they age. There is considerable work to be done to develop this concept, as each data type has its own complications. 

In this case, as time goes on, someone attempting to prove their individuality would have to spend a lot **more effort** to run the algorithms against their collected biodata, and the data **precision** needed to match the person's identity is actually **lower**. This is one example of **fidelity change**; others can make it more expensive to change a record from the past, make it harder to find out the ID of a voter, or even limit a past state's effect on the future of a blockchain. 

While the inclusion of this concept into web 4 may seem **unnecessary** at the moment, it is another guarantee of the privacy that is needed for many **social applications**. Philosophically, degradation of information also fits in with the general web 4 desire to reflect systems in nature. 

Before moving on, I do wish to stress the modularity of web 4, and that this (perhaps the most radical idea presented) is not going to fit into every web 4 system, nor should it. This idea will find its usefulness when it is time, and should NOT be adopted without clear reasoning.

# Geo-Social Harmonic Layers

Collaborative social environments are always happening everywhere humans live. Currently, we are both realizing the vast amount of ways to live abundantly, as well as what direction we should be facing to grow as a society. Human growth in the past few centuries has been focused on technological improvements rather than social improvements. [3]

> Web 4 proposes that systems based in time token are the most apt to create and improve existing social layers. 

## What is a Geo-Social Layer?

A geo-social layer is something that affects people (social) at a given location (Geo). A simple example is the governing body of an area, including all of the legislation. Another example is the customs and culture of a group of people. 

## Geographic Stratification  

Across the globe, one geopolitical pattern seem to emerge. Cities are within Counties, are within Districts (States in the USA), are within nations, are within the world. 

1. Cities (aka Towns, Commonwealths, C, etc.)
2. Counties (aka Divisions
3. Districts (aka States, Provinces)
4. Nations (aka Countries, States, Republics, etc)
5. Global

For communication, we will consider cities as the "lowest" and global as the "highest" stratification level.
 
Additionally, a **community level** may be added below cities to further add accuracy and usefulness. 

For the purpose of any geo-social system, **geographic association with each actor** must be defined. 

Traditionally, it's the existence within a certain area, such as a place of residence or business, that is of importance. When building a geo-social system, it's only necessary that association is declared at the lowest level of geographic stratification, from which the rest can be extrapolated. 

## Social 
Because each person can be associated to either a community, or a city, we can develop systems within web 4 that allow coordination at every strata with just this one piece of data for each person. 

# Democracy, Collaboration, and ever-redefining Utopia

By offering time tokens to the individual that correspond to each stratum we can create **high-fidelity democratic systems** that better represent each and every person's desires. We can know exactly what the people want, with no guesswork, in a very short period of time. 

For example, a person may be given 12 time tokens at each stratum to vote on the initiatives that they would like to see passed. They may vote all 12 tokens for an inititive they are most passionate about, or 1 token to 12 different initiatives (or 2 to 6 initiatives, etc). By collecting and counting these tokens, the governing body can **know exactly what their constituents want**, without the direct need to elect a representative who only estimates these desires. 

The democratic system described in this paper does not solve all problems, as there are still issues of voter informedness, unseen actors, and more, but it is a skeleton to build a collaborative social system that are an **improvement to the representative governments** which were once as revolutionary as these ideas are. 



# Roadmap to Web 4 Reality

## **Phase One**
> Implementing time tokens

**Time Tokens** are implemented on any and all blockchains where developers see the value. These developers provide open-source instructions and tools to helps others make their own time tokens. 

**Provable individuality** for Time Tokens is up to each application and blockchain, and these application can choose to ignore this requirement, risking their systems' integrity. **Federated** (Facetec) and **decentralized** options (Civic) may be used, and so can social verification.


**Information entropy** and **geosocial layers** are starting to be theorized, but not showing up. 

**Phase 1 Action Points**: 
- Time Token ERC proposal (and similar for other blockchains)
- Developers exploring use cases for Time Tokens 
- Developers implementing Time Token in unexpected ways

## **Phase Two**
> dApps and discovering issues

**Applications using Time Tokens** are widespread, and issues in implementations are becoming known and solved. 

**Provable identity** **issues** are becoming apparent, as certain applications with **lax rules** are being manipulated, showing the need for true provable identity. 

Social Verification and solutions like Facetec are still used, while biocryptography standards and biometric secret technology are being developed to allow true provable identity (in Phase Three).

**Information entropy** principles are starting to be implemented, when required.

**GeoSocial layers** are starting to be built, but not used for "real applications" like voting because of lack of true provable individuality. 


## **Phase Three**
> Implementing Provable Identity

**Provable Identity** is now possible as suggested in this manifesto through the maturity of the biometric secrets. Standards are being created openly, 

**GeoSocial layers** are being used to run and govern communities which are not dependent on traditional representative government. Existing governments are adopting time tokens to get a better read on what legislation the people want. 

## **Phase Four**
**Information entropy** is added to the systems where it can be of use. For example, this could make a person's (anonymous) voting record less knowable over time by increasing the amount of CPU time needed to associate one vote with another. 

**GeoSocial layers** are being used as a replacement for representative government where it is the will of the people. Voter informedness is measured and known, as are the exact desires of the people. This creates collaboration and a renewed faith in democracy, and a feeling of belongingness and appreciation for each individual. 

# Author notes

## Change Without Conflict
**No one can stop us** from building collaborative systems with web 4 and even **self-governing**. **We don't need** to "tear down the system" or separate from society to do so. **We can exist** fully embedded in the geopolitical systems around us, while implementing and improving web 4 concepts, the underpinnings of collaborative democracy.

If and when the "old system" meets its demise, as all things do, **we can transition rapidly** to a web 4 system like [Effective Collective](https://github.com/dougbutner/effective-collective) or any other, as it will already be in place. 

## Why use the term "Web 4"
It is my belief that each version of the web must 1) be built on top of the previous version, 2) be fundamentally different than the previous version by introducing new technology, and 3) have meaningful impact on society. 

This proposal for the next iteration of the web is an effort to both expand and shift the path of information science in a direction where the **meaningful impact** of society involves: 1) empowerment of each individual, which serve as the basis for collective (social), economic, and novel applications; 2) provable identity verification while maintaining complete separation from any federated system, including government, with the side-benefit of lifelong recoverability of private keys; and 3) resonance with our contained and containing systems, like our human organs and the Solar system, which provides us with free energy daily, akin to free time tokens.

While an argument could easily be made that DeFi is Web 4, or another emerging tech, like layers on top of blockchains (sidechains) are web 4, both of these are **not new**. DeFi mimics and improves the systems of the past. Sidechains are merely making web 3 **more efficient**. 

It is my hope and desire that the information presented here will be **expanded** on and **implemented** by many developers and systems in the coming years, not for the benefit of the few, but for the **empowerment** of each individual and the **harmony** of the human collective, and every layer of Gaia.
