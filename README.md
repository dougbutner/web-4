## What is Web 4.0?

Before we define web 4.0, we must look briefly at the concepts of web 1.0, web 2.0, and web 3.0

 - **Web 1.0**
Static files being served from a server to a user's browser.
 - **Web 2.0**
Dynamic pages that took user's information and desires into account. Asynchronous requests allow single page applications to thrive. Applications are still served from a central (federated) server.
 - **Web 3.0**
Decentralized web. Applications exist in distributed networks instead of a central server

Today, the top 100 websites by traffic are all web 2.0 websites .

## Defining Web 4.0

There are 3 foundational underpinnings of web 4.0

 1. Time-issued cryptocurrency 
 2. Biocryptographic signatures
 3. Socioeconomic applications

We will discuss these foundations one at a time
