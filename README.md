# Web 4.0 - The Democratic Web

## About This Repo 

This repo features a description of the next evolution of the web, web 4.0. As the technologies emerge, this repo will also feature links to the  associated technologies.

## What is Web 4.0?

Before we define web 4.0, we must look briefly at the concepts of web 1.0, web 2.0, and web 3.0. We will remove the ".0" for the rest of this document, because it's sooo web 2.

 - **Web 1**
Static files being served from a server to a user's browser.
 - **Web 2**
Dynamic pages that took user's information and desires into account. Asynchronous requests allow single page applications to thrive. Applications are still served from a central (federated) server.
 - **Web 3**
Decentralized web. Applications exist in distributed networks instead of a central server. This unfederated model trades control and censorship ability for freedom and lack of opinion. 

Today, the top 100 websites by traffic are [all](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) web 2 websites. The web 2 paradigm fits closely with the wider environment of corporate-owned information federation. 

As more and more individuals and societies are reconsidering the place of government, censorship,   and federated vs unfederated power, web 3 is emerging as a powerful, provable option to shape the evolution of society on planet Earth. 

A growing portion of websites and applications today have elements of web 3 

## Defining Web 4

There are 3 conceptual underpinnings of web 4

 1. Time-issued cryptocurrency 
 2. Biocryptographic signatures
 3. Socioeconomic applications

We will discuss these concepts one at a time.

# Time-issued cryptocurrency (Time Tokens) 

Time tokens are distributed to users based on the amount of time passed.  

Time tokens allow web 2 and web 3 applications to offer a provably democratic model to their users. 

## The concept behind Time Tokens

Time tokens rely on the following concepts

 1. **Time Unit**
A time unit MUST be a superset of a timestamp. This means that a time unit is some amount (or fraction) of a second
 2. **Time Faucet**
A time faucet provides any verified user with EXACTLY one time token per unit of time passed since their last faucet. This can be an active faucet; requiring some action by the recipient, or a passive faucet; automatically sending the cryptocurrency to the user.
 3. **Verified Recipients**
Recipients of the system must be verified to be an actual human in order to receive time tokens. The issue of verification is very serious if we are to continue from web 3 instead of taking a step backward toward federated systems (like government-issued IDs). Biocryptography is introduced as the solution to this problem.

## How do Time Tokens work?

Time tokens are based on a hash function

## Why can't web 3 do this?
Provable democracy cannot be fully achieved in web 3.0, because there is no control over how many accounts a user may control. Instead, many different models have been developed to deal with this issue, most notably, proof of work, proof of stake, and delegated proof of stake. 

These paradigms of democracy are used primarily to determine which chain of transaction blocks is considered valid, securing a blockchain. POS and DOPS are also used to in applications like Hive to allow users to declare
