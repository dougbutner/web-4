# 3. The Dual-Asset Solution

## 3.1 PRINCE Token Framework

### 3.1.1 Design Principles

The Principal Recognition and Credit Evaluation (PRINCE) token system is designed based on key principles from monetary economics (Tobin, 1963) and modern credit theory (Stiglitz & Weiss, 1981):

1. Credit History Preservation
2. Principal Repayment Recognition
3. Risk Assessment Continuity
4. Wealth Transfer Acknowledgment

### 3.1.2 Token Economics

The PRINCE token allocation follows a strict mathematical formula:

$$
PRINCE_{allocation} = \max(0, P_{paid} - P_{original})
$$

Where:
- P_{paid} = Total principal payments made
- P_{original} = Original principal borrowed

Additional weighting factors can be applied:

$$
PRINCE_{weighted} = PRINCE_{allocation} \times \prod_{i=1}^{n} w_i
$$

Where w_i represents various weighting factors such as:
- Payment consistency (α)
- Length of credit relationship (β)
- Economic sector importance (γ)

### 3.1.3 Distribution Mechanism

Following Friedman's (1969) optimal quantity of money theory, PRINCE tokens are distributed according to:

$$
\frac{dPRINCE}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \max(0, \frac{dP_{paid,i}}{dt} - \frac{dP_{original,i}}{dt})
$$

## 3.2 TIME Token System

### 3.2.1 Theoretical Foundation

TIME (Time-value Interest Measurement Equivalent) tokens are based on the fundamental time value of money principle (Fisher, 1930):

$$
TIME_{value} = PV \times (1 + r)^t - PV
$$

Where:
- PV = Present Value (Principal Amount)
- r = Risk-free rate
- t = Time period in years

### 3.2.2 Token Generation Formula

The basic TIME token allocation follows:

$$
TIME = D \times T \times R_f
$$

Where:
- D = Dollar amount of principal
- T = Time period in years
- R_f = Risk-free rate adjustment factor

For complex lending relationships:

$$
TIME_{complex} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} D(t) \times \Delta t \times R_f(t)
$$

### 3.2.3 Risk Adjustment Mechanism

Based on modern portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952), risk adjustments are calculated as:

$$
R_f(t) = R_{base} + \beta \times (R_m - R_{base}) + \sigma_{specific}
$$

Where:
- R_{base} = Base risk-free rate
- β = Systematic risk factor
- R_m = Market risk premium
- σ_{specific} = Specific risk premium

## 3.3 Token Interaction Dynamics

### 3.3.1 Cross-Token Relationships

The interaction between PRINCE and TIME tokens follows a complementary relationship:

$$
V_{total} = f(PRINCE, TIME) = \alpha PRINCE + \beta TIME + \gamma(PRINCE \times TIME)
$$

Where:
- V_{total} = Total system value
- α, β = Individual token weights
- γ = Interaction coefficient

### 3.3.2 Market Mechanism Design

Following mechanism design theory (Hurwicz & Reiter, 2006), the token system implements:

1. Incentive Compatibility:
$$
U_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \geq U_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*) \quad \forall i, s_i
$$

2. Individual Rationality:
$$
U_i(s^*) \geq U_i(0) \quad \forall i
$$

### 3.3.3 Equilibrium Properties

The system maintains stable equilibrium through:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} PRINCE_i + \sum_{j=1}^{m} TIME_j = M_{original}
$$

## 3.4 Implementation Framework

### 3.4.1 Technical Architecture

Based on distributed ledger technology principles (Narayanan et al., 2016):

1. Token Creation:
```python
def mint_tokens(debt_record):
    prince = calculate_prince(debt_record.payments, debt_record.principal)
    time = calculate_time(debt_record.principal, debt_record.duration)
    return TokenPair(prince, time)
```

2. Distribution Logic:
```python
def distribute_tokens(accounts):
    for account in accounts:
        if account.prince_eligible:
            mint_prince(account)
        if account.time_eligible:
            mint_time(account)
```

### 3.4.2 Governance Structure

Following principles from institutional economics (Ostrom, 2009):

1. Clear Boundaries
2. Proportional Equivalence
3. Collective Choice Arrangements
4. Monitoring
5. Graduated Sanctions
6. Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
7. Recognition of Rights
8. Nested Enterprises
