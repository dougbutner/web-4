# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background

The global financial system operates fundamentally as a debt-based monetary system where nearly all money is created through lending (McLeay et al., 2014). While this system has facilitated unprecedented economic growth, it contains an inherent mathematical paradox: the impossibility of all debts being repaid simultaneously due to the interest burden exceeding the money supply (Keen, 2009).

According to the Bank for International Settlements, global debt reached an unprecedented $307 trillion in mid-2023, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 336% across major economies (BIS Quarterly Review, 2023). This rising debt level, combined with the mathematical constraints of interest-bearing debt creation, presents a systemic challenge that traditional monetary policy tools have struggled to address.

## 1.2 Historical Context

The current debt-based monetary system emerged gradually after the dissolution of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 (Eichengreen, 2019). The transition to pure fiat currencies enabled unprecedented monetary expansion but also accelerated the growth of global debt. Historical attempts to address systemic debt crises include:

- The ancient Mesopotamian practice of debt jubilees (Hudson, 2018)
- The post-WWI German hyperinflation and debt reset
- The 1933 U.S. domestic debt restructuring under Executive Order 6102
- The 2008 financial crisis interventions

Each of these historical examples demonstrates both the necessity of periodic debt restructuring and the devastating consequences of uncontrolled debt collapse.

## 1.3 Problem Statement

The fundamental problem exists in three dimensions:

1. Mathematical Impossibility:
The current system requires more money for debt repayment than exists in the money supply, as demonstrated by Keen's (2015) dynamic modeling of debt-based economies. This creates an inevitable "musical chairs" scenario where some debtors must default regardless of their economic productivity or intention to repay.

2. Systemic Risk:
The interconnected nature of modern financial markets means that significant defaults can trigger cascade effects throughout the global economy (Haldane & May, 2011). The 2008 financial crisis illustrated how debt-related systemic risks can rapidly transform into global economic crises.

3. Economic Inefficiency:
The current system creates artificial scarcity of money relative to debt obligations, leading to:
   - Reduced economic activity
   - Increased inequality
   - Misallocation of resources toward debt service rather than productive investment

## 1.4 Research Objectives

This paper aims to:

1. Quantify the mathematical boundaries of debt-based monetary systems
2. Present a novel dual-asset solution that preserves economic relationships while eliminating systemic interest burden
3. Provide a practical framework for implementation that minimizes economic disruption
4. Address the regulatory and policy requirements for such a transition

## 1.5 Methodology

Our research combines:
- Mathematical modeling of money creation and debt dynamics
- Historical analysis of debt restructuring events
- System dynamics simulation of proposed solutions
- Stakeholder impact analysis

The methodology follows Ostrom's (2009) institutional analysis framework while incorporating modern monetary theory perspectives (Wray, 2015).
